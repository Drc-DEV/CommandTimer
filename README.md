A really simple plugin to time commands on your server with some unique configuration options.

Some people have a bug with the onhour function where the command would be executed multiple times. If you have a problem with this, please contact me since I can't reproduce the error by myself.


Features :

   
    Custom messages
    Custom commands
    Execute commands on load
    Execute commands after x seconds
    Execute commands at x hour (HH:MM)
    Execute commands on a specific day
    Execute commands as Operator/Player/Console
    Randomizer
    API
    Permissions per task
    No lag
    Backwards compatibility
    Handy GUI



Commands :

    /commandtimer : Opens the GUI to manage the plugin
    Permission : commandtimer.use


Commands are not used any more in 2.0+ and a GUI is used instead.

Also note that when you create a command, always start by adding a command first before changing any other options, this may cause some errors


To do :

    Add bungeecord support
    Force start a task on command
    Commands that trigger other commands
